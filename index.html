        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <p>
          <b>My code is broken! Can you fix it?</b>
          <p>
            If it is a <i class="emp">small mishap or code breaking that is not of your doing (image or music hosting problems)</i>, Kingdom Corp. will gladly fix the issue for you for <span class="price">free</span>. But if it <i class="emp">changes a large part of your code (even if it breaks because of RPC updates) and will take a while to fix</i>, there will be a fee equal to a <span class="price">Fundamental Code Edits Add On</span>.
          </p>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>I want a code edit but you didn't make the original profile. Can I still avail of that add on?</b>
          <p>
            Yes, but under the condition that <i class="emp">you and Kingdom Corp. both ask permission individually from the original coder to alter the profile.</i> If they refuse, you may not avail of the add on.
          </p>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Can I request a profile instead of commission a profile?</b>
          <p>
            We will announce when we are open for requests and how many slots we are going to take. However, it is <span class="price">no guarantee</span> that we will accept your request, but we will evaluate which profiles appeal to us the most.
          </p>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Do you provide code tutorials or code appraisals?</b>
          <p>
            We may <span class="emp">answer a question or two, or give passing advice</span> on profile improvements but anything in depth is not something we can do with our current schedule. If one da we do offer this service, it will show up in our Add Ons section.
